## Installation and Setup Instructions

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Reflection

  - Context: This project is part of my ongoing exploration of web development technologies and was undertaken during my study at Universitas Nasional.

  - Objective: The main goal was to build an application that simplifies event management, enabling users to create and participate in events

  - Challenges: Managing event details and implementing ticket purchasing functionality presented challenges. I invested time in researching these aspects to ensure a robust and efficient solution.

  - Unexpected Obstacles: Adapting the project to accommodate ticket purchasing and ensuring a seamless user experience posed unexpected challenges.

  - Tooling: I chose Next.js 14 for its improved performance and TypeScript support. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach for styling, while MongoDB serves as the backend database. Vercel simplifies deployment, Shadcn beautiful, accessible, and customizable, Stripe for the payment gateaway, and Clerk handles the user authentication.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Next JS 14, Typescript, MongoDB, Clerk, Shadcn, Stripe and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX/TSX, and TailwindCSS.
